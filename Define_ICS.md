# Differences in Deployments in ICS

## What is an ICS?

ICS refers to the facilities, systems, and equipment that comprise the operational real-time control environment, services, diagnostics, and functional capbilities necessary for the effective and reliable operation of automation systems. 

ICS - devices or set of devices that manage the behavior of other devices.

An ICS system is an interconnection of components related in such a mannner as to command, direct, or regulate itself or another system. 

Examples include:

- A batch mixing process contained in a chemical plant

- Tracking and coordination of train movement over a busy rail system.

## Types of ICS?

**Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA)**

- A large scale, distributed measurement and control system. SCADA systems are used in the transmission and distribution of oil, gas, water, and electricity.

**Distributed Control System (DCS)**

- A system where control is achieved by the distribution of live data (intelligence) throughout the controlled system, rather than from a centrally located single unit. DCS are used in power generation, chemical processing, oil refining, and wastewater treatment.

**Process Control System (PCS)**

- A general term that encompasses several types of control systems used in industrial production, including SCADA, DCS, and other smaller control system configurations such as programmable logic controllers (PLC). PCS are used in water treatment, chemical processing, mining, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing.

**Energy Management System (EMS)**

- A system of computer-aided tools used by operators of electric utility grids to monitor, control, and optimize the performance of the generation and/or transmission system. EMS are used in electrical energy and pump optimization.

**Automation System (AS)**

- A technology concerned with performing a process by means of programmed commands combined with automatic ffeedback control to ensure proper execution of the instructions. The resulting system is capable of operating without human intervention. AS are used in material handling and discrete manufacturing.

**Safety Instrumented System (SIS)**

- An engineered set of hardware and software controls commonly used on critical process safety systems. SIS are especially useful in safety shutdown and equipment protection systems.

**Other Automated Control Systems**

- An example of another automated control system is a building automation system (BAS), such as automatic doors, or controls for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)


## What are Uses of ICS?

Examples of processes - Purifying water, landing airplanes, and distilling chemicals. 

ICS have components that are common to controlling processes, even if the processes are different. 

Because of differences within process environments, there will also be differences in ICS implementations.

**Example**

One process may be designed to shut off the product flow into a vessel based on the level the product has reached, while another process uses the product weight or a calculation of volumetric flow as a control. 

## ICS and Cybersecurity

Initially, physical security was the primary concern due to a safety perspective, rather than a system protection concern. 

Cybersecurity was not considered a problem because ICS were not interconnected and were located within trusted environments. 

As products became more sophisticated with regards to IT functionality - remote access or interconnectivity with standards-based networks, vulnerabilities were introduced.
